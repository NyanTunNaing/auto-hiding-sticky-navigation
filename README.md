# Auto Hiding Sticky Navigation

Welcome to my collection of creative developers' works. This one features features a dynamic navigation system that intelligently responds to user scrolling:

Scroll Down: The navigation bar smoothly disappears to maximize content visibility

Scroll Up: The navigation instantly reappears for quick access

User Interaction: The navigation remains visible when hovered or focused, ensuring accessibility

This behavior enhances user experience by balancing screen real estate with convenient access to navigation controls.

## Run Locally

```bash
  git clone https://link-to-project

```bash
  cd my-project
```
